Sample subprojects structure to test if it is possible to pack all the pure java projects and sub AAR to one AAR.

It means that all java classes from subprojects are available inside resulting AAR.

TODO: pack all classes inside classes.jar, not collect them inside libs folder of resulting AAR.
